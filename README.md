# CARBON-CALCULATOR-PROGRAM-TO-TEST-AND-REDUCE-GREEN-HOUSE-GASES-GHG-IN-THE-CITY-BY-15-


Kampala City Council would like to implement LCCF (Low Carbon Cities Framework). As such develop a 
Carbon Calculator Program that helps Kampala City Council to test and simulate where they can reduce 
GHG (Green House Gases) in the city by 15%. Kampala City Council has identified the following variables to 
be major contributors to GHG in the city: Industry – 19%, De-forestation – 17%, Power & Energy – 15%, 
Agriculture – 14%, Transportation – 10%, Waste – 10%, Water Management – 10% and Buildings – 5%. 
The program must ask the user to input the percentage of cuts in the relevant 8 variables in the given 
order amounting to a total of 15% cut of GHG.
Your answer should have atleast 7 conceptes listed below. 
1. Algorithm depiction in the form of flow chart or pseudocode.
2. Decision constructs usage.
3. Usage of loops.
4. Usage of arrays.
5. Incorporation of modular programming (Functions with and without arguments).
6. Incorporation of system functions.
7. Incorporation of function overloading.
8. Adhering to project specification and guidelines.
9. Reducing redundancy in code.
